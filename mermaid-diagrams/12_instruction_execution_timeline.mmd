    title Instruction Execution Multi-Cycle Process
    
    section Cycle 1 IF
        Fetch : CPU reads instruction from memory
              : Program Counter points to instruction address
              : Instruction loaded into Instruction Register
    
    section Cycle 2 ID
        Decode : Control unit analyzes instruction opcode
               : Determine operation type and required operands
               : Read source registers if needed
    
    section Cycle 3 EX
        Execute : ALU performs the actual computation
                : Address calculation for memory operations
                : Branch condition evaluation
    
    section Cycle 4 MEM
        Memory : Read data from memory for LOAD instructions
               : Write data to memory for STORE instructions
               : Skip this phase for register-only operations
    
    section Cycle 5 WB
        Writeback : Store result in destination register
                  : Update processor flags if needed
                  : Prepare for next instruction
