    title Instruction Fetch RISC vs CISC Timing
    
    section RISC Fetch Pattern
        Cycle 1 : Fetch 32-bit instruction at PC
                : Decode starts immediately
                : PC equals PC plus 4 predictable
        
        Cycle 2 : Fetch next 32-bit instruction at PC plus 4
                : Previous instruction in decode
                : Pipeline flows smoothly
        
        Cycle 3 : Fetch next 32-bit instruction at PC plus 8
                : Consistent 4-byte increments
                : No fetch stalls
    
    section CISC Fetch Pattern
        Cycle 1 : Fetch first bytes at PC
                : Don't know instruction length yet
                : Partial decode to determine size
        
        Cycle 2 : May need additional fetch
                : Instruction could be 1-15 bytes
                : PC increment unknown until decode
        
        Cycle 3 : Complete instruction decode
                : Finally know next PC value
                : Pipeline may stall waiting
